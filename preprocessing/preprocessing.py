class PreProcessing:
    """
    Class to produce necessary grid files for downscaling runoff into streamflow.

    The following input files (gdbs, raster) are necessary in the setup_folder:

    - flow_dir_15s_by_continent.gdb (with raster datasets containing flow directions of HydroSheds),
    - pixel_area_skm_15s.gdb\px_area_skm_15s (gdb raster dataset with area of HydroSheds grid cells),
    - flowdir_30min.tif (rasterfile with flow directions of WaterGAP (DDM30)),
    - orgDDM30area.tif (rasterfile with areas of WaterGAP grid cells),
    - pixareafraction_glolakres_15s.tif (rasterfile with values in HR grid cells which are covered by a global lake or
      reservoir, the value correspond to the fraction of the area of all global lakes or reservoirs in the LR grid cell
      contained in the HR grid cell. For example, if an LR grid cell is completely contained within a lake or reservoir,
      then allHR grid cells within would have a value of 1/14400)

    The following files / grids are produced in outputdir:

    - continents_dir_15s.tif (HR raster with flow directions clipped to continents of interest),
    - continents_shiftgrid.tif (LR raster with percentage of how much a correction value should be shifted downstream),
    - continents_keepgrid.tif (LR raster shiftgrid -1 i.e. how much a correction value should be kept),
    - continents_largeRiverMask.tif (LR raster with 1 where there is a *large* river with matching LR and HR river networks,
        and 0 in smaller rivers or large rivers with mismatches),
    - continents_gap_flowacc.tif (LR flow accumulation grid of cells which are not *large* rivers with fitting river networks
      (largeRiverMask.Not)),
    - continents_cellpourpoint_15s.tif (HR grid with 1 where the HR grid cell has the maximum upstream area per LR grid
      cell),
    - continents_pixarea_15s.tif (HR grid with area of HR grid cells),
    - pixareafraction_glolakres_15s.tif (rasterfile with values in HR grid cells which are covered by a global lake or
      reservoir, the value correspond to the fraction of the area of all global lakes or reservoirs in the LR grid cell
      contained in the HR grid cell. For example, if an LR grid cell is completely contained within a lake or reservoir,
      then allHR grid cells within would have a value of 1/14400)
    - landratio_correction.tif (LR grid on the land to continental area ratio to correct runoff values, is just copied)

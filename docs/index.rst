Welcome to DRYvER Downscaling's documentation!
==============================================

This python package is designed to provide a downscaling algorithm from WaterGAP 2.2e 0.5 degree output to 15 arc
seconds discharge.

The actual downscaling is done in the method run_ts (:ref:`run-ts-label`) of the DryverDownscaling class.
